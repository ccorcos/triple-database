// Now we're on to evaluating queries... And updating indexes...
// This means, we need some amount of query planning for computing the "rest" of a query for a given update.
// This is a higher level concept than strictly a tuple database...
// We should generalize the "ReactiveStorage" so we can re-use these primitives for indexing.

// Sounds like we're approaching where I was last think week!
// 1. do we need to worry about sort direction? maybe a later iteration. maybe by that time, we'll have

// tuple-indexer
// - no sort direction.
// - query planner, but no heuristics yet?
