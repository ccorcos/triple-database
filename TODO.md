## TODO

- readme
	- explain how it all works
	- install tuple-database as a peer dependency
	- triplestore-repl
	- EXPLAIN documentation



- data-type-ts / hyperstruct



- send tuples back and forth between a database in two different processes using traces and transactions.
- shorthand queries `$()` syntax for defining variables.
	- or just jump straight ahead to proxies.


- Reactivity for `triplestore.queryFacts` with seemless in-memory index.

- convenient syntax:
- delete index?
- {and: []}, {or: []}

- deterministic query name
	- query optimization

- .scan -> .range?
